                                    <p>Calamba City situated along Laguna de Bay takes advantage of its opportunities. All year round, tourists are attracted to the famous Wonder Island, set in the middle of the lake. This provides not only picturesque view but more so private jet-ski facilities and boat sailing thrills. Laguna de Bay is a large shallow freshwater body in the heart of Luzon Island with an aggregate area of about 911 km2 (352 sq mi) and a shoreline of 220 km (140 mi). It is considered to be the third largest inland body of water in Southeast Asia after Tonle Sap in Cambodia and Lake Toba in Sumatra, Indonesia. Laguna de Bay is bordered by the province of Laguna in the east, west and southwest, the province of Rizal in the north to northeast, and Metropolitan Manila in the northwest. The lake has an average depth of 2.8 meters (9 ft 2 in) and its excess water is discharged through the Pasig River.</p>

                                    <p>Mt. Makiling Forest Reserve serves the interest of adventurous people who love mountain climbing, bird watching, nature gazing, and camping. Mt, Makiling with its foot resting on the side of the city is the best venue for such gratification. And for those plant lovers, ornamental gardens are abounding in Barangays Real, Pansol, and Bagong Kalsada. They sell different kinds of plants, compost, fertilizers, pots, tools, and landscaping products. Mount Makiling is an inactive stratovolcano located in the provinces of Laguna and Batangas on the island of Luzon in the Philippines. The mountain rises to an elevation of 1,090 meters above mean sea level and is the highest feature of the Laguna Volcanic Field. The volcano has no recorded historic eruption, but volcanism is still evident through geothermal features like mud springs and hot springs. South of the mountain is the Makiling–Banahaw Geothermal Plant. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology classifies the volcano as "Inactive". Mount Makiling is a state-owned forest reserve administered by the University of the Philippines Los Baños. Prior to its transfer to the university, the mountain was the first national park of the Philippines. Mount Makiling National Park was established on February 23, 1933, by Proclamation No. 552.</p>
